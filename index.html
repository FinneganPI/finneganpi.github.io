    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <ul class="faq-list">
      <li>
        <strong>Should I only hire a private investigator who is licensed in the State of California?</strong>
        <p>Yes. California law requires private investigators to hold a valid license issued by the Bureau of Security and Investigative Services. Hiring a licensed professional ensures they meet the legal standards necessary to conduct private investigations in the State of California. My private investigator's license number is 189960, and it can be verified at <a href="https://search.dca.ca.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">search.dca.ca.gov</a>.</p>
      </li>
      
      <li>
        <strong>Should a private investigator carry insurance?</strong>
        <p>Yes. Although it’s not required by law, carrying general and professional liability insurance is highly recommended. It demonstrates that a private investigator is serious, professional, and financially responsible. I carry both general and professional liability insurance to reassure my clients that they are working with a qualified professional.</p>
      </li>
      
      <li>
        <strong>What professional background and areas of specialization should I look for?</strong>
        <p>Look for private investigators with relevant law enforcement, legal, or investigative experience aligned with your specific case type. As a retired police officer with 28 years of service, a Bachelor of Science degree in Criminal Justice, and advanced studies in mathematics, I possess the skills, knowledge, and experience to investigate a wide variety of case types.</p>
      </li>
      
      <li>
        <strong>Can my investigation be handled outside of regular business hours?</strong>
        <p>Yes. Investigative work often requires flexibility beyond a 9–5 schedule. I will work with you to ensure your investigation is conducted during the hours of the day and days of the week that best suit your case.</p>
      </li>
      
      <li>
        <strong>How will my confidentiality be protected?</strong>
        <p>All case files, communications, and findings are managed under strict confidentiality. Information will only be shared with you, mutually agreed upon sources, or as otherwise required by law.</p>
      </li>
      
      <li>
        <strong>Who will be responsible for managing and conducting my investigation?</strong>
        <p>I will personally manage and conduct every aspect of your case, and you will have direct access to me throughout the investigation.</p>
      </li>
      
      
      <li>
        <strong>Will you coordinate with my attorney throughout the process?</strong>
        <p>Yes. I will work with any entity of your request, including your attorney, to ensure my investigative strategy supports your overall legal objectives. I will maintain open communication with your attorney, provide timely updates, and tailor the investigation and reporting to meet the specific needs of your case.</p>
      </li>
      
      <li>
        <strong>When the investigation concludes, will I receive a report?</strong>
        <p>Yes. Upon conclusion, you will receive a report of your choosing. It can be anything from a comprehensive written report, including timelines, findings, and evidence collected, to a simple verbal summary of findings. Final reports are often dictated by the case type, but can be tailored to your request.</p>
      </li>
      
      <li>
        <strong>How can I be sure your methods comply with legal and ethical standards?</strong>
        <p>All investigative activities strictly adhere to California law, BSIS regulations, and professional ethical standards. I will not employ unauthorized or illegal investigative practices.</p>
      </li>
      
      <li>
        <strong>If my case goes to court, can you serve as a witness?</strong>
        <p>Yes. I am prepared and experienced in providing courtroom testimony for criminal, civil, and administrative hearings.</p>
      </li>
      
      <li>
        <strong>Will there be a written agreement outlining the scope, fees, and terms?</strong>
        <p>Yes. Per section 7524 of the Business and Professions code, you will receive a clear, written agreement detailing the scope of services, fee structure, and other conditions before any work begins.</p>
      </li>
      
      <li>
        <strong>Can you guarantee the outcome I’m seeking?</strong>
        <p>No. While I can commit to conducting a thorough and lawful investigation, ethical standards prohibit promising specific results. My role is to uncover objective facts and deliver accurate findings.</p>
      </li>
