          <h2>Administrative & Workplace Investigations</h2>
          <p>
            Administrative and workplace investigations are fact-based inquiries often initiated after allegations of misconduct, policy violations,
            or complaints such as harassment, discrimination, retaliation, or other conduct creating legal or operational risk for an organization.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Employee misconduct</strong> and policy violations</li>
            <li><strong>Harassment, discrimination, and retaliation</strong> complaints</li>
            <li><strong>Workplace violence</strong>, threats, intimidation, safety incidents</li>
            <li><strong>Ethics violations</strong> and conflicts of interest</li>
            <li><strong>Failure to follow procedures</strong> or supervisory direction</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            My approach emphasizes confidentiality, thorough interviews, evidence review, timeline development, credibility analysis, and clear documentation.

          <h2>About Chris Finnegan</h2>
          <p>
            I am a California-licensed private investigator who retired from the California Highway Patrol in 2022 after 28 years of dedicated service. I hold a Bachelor of Science degree in Criminal Justice from California State University, Long Beach, and have pursued advanced studies in mathematics. My investigative expertise is built on a broad career in both patrol officer and supervisory roles. These include serving as a Patrol Officer/Supervisor, Investigative Unit Supervisor, Academy Firearms Instructor, and Commercial Vehicle Unit Supervisor, as well as holding administrative assignments responsible for writing, reviewing, and interpreting policy at the highest levels of the Department. I have extensive experience conducting criminal and administrative investigations that routinely resulted in criminal charges or disciplinary actions. My promise to every client is to deliver a thorough, ethical, and confidential investigation that uncovers the facts of each case.
          </p>

        <section>
          <h2>Regular Service Area</h2>
          <p>
            I regularly serve clients in the following California counties:

          <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

          <p><strong>Should I only hire a private investigator licensed in California?</strong><br>
            Yes. California private investigators must hold a valid license issued by the Bureau of Security and Investigative Services.
            My PI license number is <strong>189960</strong> and can be verified at
            <a href="https://search.dca.ca.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">search.dca.ca.gov</a>.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Should a private investigator carry insurance?</strong><br>
            Yes. Although not required by law, general and professional liability insurance is strongly recommended and is an indicator of professionalism.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Who conducts the investigation?</strong><br>
            I personally manage and conduct every aspect of the case, and you will have direct access to me throughout the process.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Will you coordinate with our attorney?</strong><br>
            Yes. I will coordinate with any entity you request, including legal counsel, to align investigative strategy and reporting with your objectives.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Will we receive a report?</strong><br>
            Yes. You can receive anything from a comprehensive written report with timelines, findings, and supporting materials, to a verbal summary, depending on your needs.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Will there be a written agreement outlining scope and fees?</strong><br>
            Yes. You will receive a clear written agreement detailing scope, fee structure, and conditions before work begins.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Can you guarantee the outcome I’m seeking?</strong><br>
            No. Ethical standards prohibit promising specific results. My commitment is a thorough, lawful, objective investigation.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Request a No-Obligation Confidential Consultation</h2>
          <p>
            If you need an independent investigator for a workplace matter, administrative investigation, or related investigative service, contact me to discuss scope and next steps.
